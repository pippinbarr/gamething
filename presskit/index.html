    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Each episode, experimental game designer Pippin Barr and oral historian David Wolinsky choose a game then both
      play it separately and exchange answerphone messages about it until the tape runs out. The result is
      conversations about anything and everything (mostly everything) they find interesting about videogames.
    </p>

    <p>
      Every season of <em>GAMETHING</em> tackles a theme. Season 3 was about simulators, Season 4 is about horror, and
      Season 5 (recording underway) is about Code and Computation. Pippin and David use the theme as a jumping off point
      for choosing the games, finding
      "small moments done well" in play, and poking at connections between life and games. You'll hear everything from
      Pippin trying to puzzle through how Baudrilliard's "Desert of the Real" relates to simulator games, to David
      talking about emotional labour in a horror role-playing game, to both trying (and sometimes
      actually managing) to talk about how games feel as a result of their underlying design.
    </p>

    <p>
      For those already deeply into games, every episode invites listeners to come along on an introspective
      playthrough of a game with fresh eyes, with special attention to that season's Big Idea. For those looking for
      ways into understanding games, <em>GAMETHING</em> is a way to indulge some curiosity about this weird and
      thrilling medium, with the comfort of being anchored by that same Big Idea's relevance to "real life."
    </p>

    <p>
      In short: What are videogames? And <em>why</em> are they?

  <section id="history">
    <h2>History</h2>
    <p>
      Pippin and David have been collaborating on <em>GAMETHING</em> since 2018 with alphabetical audio experiments
      about videogames, beginning with <em>Alone in the Dark</em> and making it as far as <em>Little Computer
        People</em>. Seasons 1 and 2 followed this approach into poetry, musical performance, sonic collage, and more.
    </p>
    <p>
      In late 2022, we got back into the saddle with a total reset. Instead of experimental audio, we decided to try
      something novel: What if we actually <em>talked about games</em> instead?
