      <p>
        <em>GAMETHING</em> is an audio book-club about videogames. Each episode, experimental game designer Pippin Barr
        and oral historian David Wolinsky choose a game to play separately and exchange answering machine messages
        about it until the tape runs out. The result is a conversation about anything and everything (mostly everything)
        they find interesting about videogames.

            SEASON 6

            SPEEDRUNNING

      <p>
        In <strong>Season 6</strong>,
        <em>GAMETHING</em> laces up its trainers and goes speedrunning. We explore how game design can challenge the
        need for speed, obsess over the subculture's fanaticism, and set a few world records in the process.

      </p>
      <p>
        Seasons 1 and 2, produced in 2018, are considered
        "lost." They were pretty experimental and Season 3 came about
        when we asked ourselves "what if we actually <em>talked about games</em>?" But wait! If you want to hear the
        first two seasons, they're available if you <a href="https://patreon.com/othergamethings">support us on
