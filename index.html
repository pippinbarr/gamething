        <p>
          GAMETHING is answerphone messages between Pippin Barr and David Wolinsky that explore videogames from top to bottom. Each season explores a specific theme, such as <em>simulation</em> or <em>horror</em>, and discusses one game per episode. The physics of loneliness? Police officers who can't say sorry? Death by dysentery? GAMETHING has it all.
