      <p>
        <em>GAMETHING</em> is an audio book-club about videogames. Each episode, experimental game designer Pippin Barr
        and oral historian David Wolinsky choose a game to play separately and exchange answering machine messages
        about it until the tape runs out. The result is a conversation about anything and everything (mostly everything)
        they find interesting about videogames.

      <p>
        In <strong>Season 10</strong>, we wade into selections from the Independent Games Festival's deep end—<a
          href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuovo_Award">the Nuovo
          Award</a>, a category meant to honor "thinking differently about videogames." We play a decade of entries that
        promise the experimental—spying, drowning, rewriting histories, finding meaningful dead ends, making flowers—and
        come to terms with what "new" even means when it's always being redefined.
      </p>
      <p>
        Seasons 1 and 2, produced in 2018, are
        "lost." They were pretty experimental and Season 3 came about years later
        when we asked ourselves "what if we actually <em>talked about games</em>?" But wait! If you want to hear the
        first two seasons – we just found them!! – they're available if you <a
